== Description ==

VW Healthcare is a good theme to design professional websites for hospitals, medical clinics, plastic surgeons, laser treatment centers, dermatologists, dentists, and any health care expert or worker related to the healthcare industry. It is a multipurpose theme that can fit any purpose. The simple and sophisticated layout designed with a minimal approach is the key. This helps to give a clear and stunning display of all your healthcare and medical services. It consists of all the modern features and an SEO-friendly design that gives a better chance to your website to pop up in the higher SERP ranks. WPML and RTL compatibility makes your theme translation ready helping your business to go beyond the language borders. The user-friendly customization options do not need you to write codes while making the changes in the layout. As it utilizes the Bootstrap framework, the outcome is a streamlined design loading at a tremendous speed giving faster page load time. The interactive part of your website is taken care of by the themeâ€™s Call To Action Buttons (CTA) and the stunning CSS animations increase its visual appeal. You will find so many sections such as About Us, Testimonial Section, etc. that will give a detailed representation of every aspect regarding your healthcare service.
